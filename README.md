# Salary Prediction Machine Learning Project

## 📖 Description
This project uses a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on features like total experience, education level, and graduation year.

## 🚀 Features
* **Model:** Uses a Random Forest (or similar) model.
* **Key Finding:** `Total_Experience` was found to be the most important feature for predicting salary.
* **Saved Model:** The final trained model is saved in the `salary_model.joblib` file.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries (like pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).
3.  Run the `salary_prediction_model.ipynb` notebook.
